                <p>Software architecture has as many approaches as there are software projects. Any glimpse of it provides some answers and many questions. But also, it always teaches a new lesson for the future in the field.
This assignment’s goal is to analyze four Software Architecture papers focussing on how their contributions are relevant to my career, as well as stating my level of conformance with the authors' arguments.</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, one of the contributions I find more relevant in the paper is the one described as redundant. The Scenarios View is conceieved to be a link between the other 4 views, but I think its importance runs even deeper into the software architecture.</p>
                <p>It all begins when first starting a software project. The services to provide are clear, but then it arrives the question: how is it going to be done? It is tricky to start thinking about tasks and processes not even knowing if it will work. So user cases are read again, but with the mind in software solutions. If two devices need to be communicated, what kind of network connection is used? Is latency important here –do we need a separated task? These an other questions lead to architectural decision-making –and decisions need to be reflected somewhere.</p>
<p>Third assignment showed me that. Process definition and mapping cannot be done out of the blue – it has to match an architecture yet to be described. When jumping directly from logical view to execution view (process view focussing), you realise there are many things that needed to be thought of before. If the project is simple (or so it is the level of detail you are interested in), probably decisions are made on the fly without complications. But for bigger or “deeper” projects, making a Scenarios View first would have the advantage not only to simplify the development of the project but also to transform abstract concepts into real-life issues. And it keeps them on paper for everyone to understand and consult them later on.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think Scenarios will be useful during my career whenever I need to conceive or develop a software project as it will help me discover and describe the best software solutions to the incoming issues.</p>
<p>The other thing I find interesting for my career is Logical View’s definition. For me, the concepts beneath a service or functionality in a piece of software have always been given for granted. I have never had to explain my ideas of a software
￼project to anyone, I just had to develop it on my own or with very few people. But, as it was said in the lectures, the complexity comes when external people have to get into it. Because of that, I think the description and instructions that are given in the paper are very relevant, as they allow abstract concepts to be described following some rules and specifying a leyend that clarifies them.</p>
<p>In particular, I think that something that the paper talks about in Logical View is usually forgotten and the authors are right to mention it: identifying elements that are common across the system. It happens to me, and I think in general, that it seems simplier to just code regarding on our present needs than to take time before and think about what is common across the system and can be reused or adapted. If it is taken into acount during the Logical View specification it will enable us to be more efficient and also more clear through the next stages of development.</p>
<p>Finally, I think the object-oriented paradigm correspondation with the view enriches it, as object-oriented is very up to date and their advantages have been more than proved. It will help to the Logical view’s cohesion.</p>
<p>All in all, I think that a Logical View done following the paper’s description will be relevant to any software project. It won’t only display the concepts of a software piece to the external public, but will also help saving resources by identifying common elements and will set the foundations of an object-oriented-based development.</p>
